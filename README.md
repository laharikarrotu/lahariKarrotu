## About

I'm a Software Engineer with experience building and maintaining backend services, data pipelines, and AI-enabled applications in production. My work focuses on Python and FastAPI, with hands-on experience deploying and operating systems on AWS and Azure. I've worked on API design, database optimization, and AI/ML service integration, and I'm comfortable supporting applications through deployment, monitoring, and ongoing improvements.

I prefer building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and designed with real-world constraints in mind.
